selfnotary
==========


selfnotary is a "Notary process guide" created by Feathercoin forum member @Slavco. 

The process can be used with Feathercoin or any bitcoin based blockchain to perform "Notary"  without any third party involvement. 

The tool will generate address from any document and creating transaction with minimum amount using your own wallet will be enough to prove that you are the document owner from transaction time until now.

All you need to have is document ( to find transaction via address ) and wallet backup ( to be able to sign message ).
